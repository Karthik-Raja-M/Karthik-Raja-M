👋 Hi, I’m Karthik Raja M  
👀 I’m interested in automation testing, UI automation frameworks, and improving test efficiency.  
🌱 I’m currently learning Playwright for UI automation and enhancing my skills with TypeScript and Java.  
💞️ I want to collaborate on automation projects, especially around testing frameworks like Selenium, TestNG, and Playwright.  
📫 How to reach me: You can connect with me on GitHub or via LinkedIn.

⚡ Fun fact: I’ve automated so many tests that I sometimes wish to automate my Tea breaks too!😄😄😄
